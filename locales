It appears that there is a misunderstanding in the task provided. The patch information given does not contain any actual changes to apply to the existing code. The diff provided only indicates the creation of a new file named 'locales' with no content (as indicated by the index hashes 0000000..e69de29, where e69de29 is a placeholder for an empty file in git).

Since there is no existing code provided to which the patch could be applied, and the patch itself does not contain any changes, it is not possible to provide a full code response as requested.

If you have an existing codebase and a proper patch with changes, please provide the original code and the full patch content so that I can assist you in applying the patch and provide you with the updated full code.
